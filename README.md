# cdk-on-demand-minecraft-server

`cdk-on-demand-minecraft-server` is an AWS CDK App that sets up an on-demand Minecraft server using AWS. The server automatically starts when players connect and stops when idle, helping reduce costs by running only when needed.

## Motivation

This project set up a quick, low-cost way to play Minecraft with friends without needing a 24/7 server. The idea was to spin up the server only when needed and save on costs by shutting it down when idle. Along the way, it was a chance to learn about using ECS for container management and EFS for persistent storage. üòä

## Environment Variables

### Required:
- **ECS_MINECRAFT_EDITION**: `java` or `bedrock` - Specify the Minecraft edition.
- **ROUTE53_SERVER_SUBDOMAIN**: Subdomain for the server (e.g., "minecraft").
- **ROUTE53_DOMAIN**: Domain for the server (e.g., "example.com").
- **ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE_ID**: Hosted Zone ID in Route 53.
- **SNS_EMAIL**: Email address for SNS notifications.
- **AWS_DESTINATION_ACCOUNT**: AWS Account ID for resource deployment.
- **AWS_DESTINATION_REGION**: AWS Region for resource deployment.

### AWS Configuration:
- **AWS_STACK_NAME**: Name of the CDK stack (`MinecraftServerStack`)

### Tips:
- **Rename `.env_example` to `.env`** and configure before deployment.
- Ensure all **required** variables are set, especially DNS and SNS.

## Deployment

Requires `Go` (1.23+) + `cdk` (2.16+). You'll also need an AWS Account. Furthermore a Route 53 domain and a  Hosted Zone ID is required for this deployment to work.

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cbrgm/cdk-on-demand-minecraft-server.git
   cd cdk-on-demand-minecraft-server
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Rename `.env_example` to `.env`:
     ```
     mv .env_example .env
     ```
   - Adjust `.env` to set the required and optional environment variables.

3. **Deploy the CDK Stack**
   ```
   make sync
   make cdk-deploy
   ```

- **Route 53 (Global)**: DNS service. When users access the Minecraft server via `SERVER_SUBDOMAIN.DOMAIN`, Route 53 directs the DNS query, initiating the process.
- **CloudWatch Logs (us-east-1)**: Captures DNS logs from Route 53.
- **Log Forwarder Lambda (us-east-1)**: Forwards DNS logs from the `us-east-1` log group to a log group in a user-defined region.
- **CloudWatch Logs (custom-region)**: Receives forwarded DNS logs, triggering further events.
- **AWS Lambda (custom-region)**: Analyzes log data and sets the `desired-count` of the ECS Service to 1, starting the Minecraft server and watchdog containers.
- **ECS Service (custom-region)**: Manages deployment of Minecraft server and watchdog containers, running them on-demand and stopping to save costs.
- **Minecraft Server Container (custom-region)**: Hosts the actual Minecraft game server, using EFS for persistent game data.
- **Watchdog Container (custom-region)**: Monitors Minecraft server activity, stopping the server if no players are active for a set period.
- **EFS (Elastic File System, custom-region)**: Provides persistent storage for game data, ensuring it‚Äôs preserved even when the server stops.
- **SNS (custom-region)**: Sends alerts to users when the server starts or stops.

## Back of the Envelope Cost Calculation (Under $10/Month)

**Disclaimer**: The pricing heavily depends on usage patterns. There are certainly cheaper options for running a Minecraft server, but this setup is serverless, offering flexibility and scalability, which comes at a cost.

### Assumptions:
- **ECS Fargate**: 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, 24 hours/month
- **AWS Lambda**: Minimal usage, within Free Tier (10,000 invocations)
- **CloudWatch**: 1 GB logs/month, within Free Tier
- **EFS**: 10 GB storage
- **Route 53**: 1 hosted zone, 10,000 queries/month
- **SNS**: Minimal usage, within Free Tier

## FAQ / Learnings

### DNS query logging only works in `us-east-1`?
- Yes, for Route 53 DNS query logging, the CloudWatch log group must be in `us-east-1`. Whoever decided that...

### Vendor logs can‚Äôt be forwarded across regions?
- Correct. Route 53 and similar logs can't be forwarded directly to log groups in other regions.
- Use a Firehose stream or Lambda to move logs between regions. I'm using a lambda function here.

### CDK stacks can‚Äôt deploy to multiple regions?
- No. Deploying resources to different regions requires splitting into separate stacks.

### CloudWatch logs are gzipped?
- Yes, they are. You can't just forward events directly; you need to handle decompression first.
